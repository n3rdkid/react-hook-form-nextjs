Test out the following: 

- [ ] Need to be able to access value anywhere  (formik.values.[name])
- [ ] Handle Blur events (So that we can show errors only after form itmes have been touched )
- [ ] Access to errors 
- [ ] Validation with yup
- [ ] Set errors to form fields (formik.setFieldError("))
